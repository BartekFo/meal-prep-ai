# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] **Module-First Architecture**: Does this feature follow `src/lib/modules/[feature]/` structure with actions/, components/, db/queries.ts, schema/, index.ts?
- [ ] **Type Safety & Validation**: Are arktype schemas defined for all data boundaries? Are neverthrow Results used for error-prone operations?
- [ ] **Database-First Design**: Are schema changes in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` with migrations generated? Are queries separated in module db/queries.ts?
- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**: Does this feature respect Better Auth + hooks.server.ts protection patterns?
- [ ] **Component Reusability**: Have existing components in `src/lib/components/ui/` been checked before creating new ones?
- [ ] **Linting Standards**: Will code pass Biome (ultracite) and ESLint checks?
- [ ] **Technology Constraints**: Does this feature use only approved technologies (Bun, SvelteKit, Drizzle, arktype, Better Auth, sveltekit-superforms, neverthrow, bits-ui, Tailwind)?

**Complexity Justification Required If**:
- Creating a new module that duplicates functionality
- Bypassing validation or Result patterns
- Introducing new technology not in constitution
- Violating module structure

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
